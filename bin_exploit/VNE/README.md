After running the program, it seems I have to create an ENVIRONMENT variable named `SECRET_DIR`. So I decide to search Google :D

After creating, I don't know how to do next so I need to see the hints :">

In my view, the hints say that the `bin` file is running the `ls` command, therefore we need to add more commands to get the flag. Therefore I think we just need to add `;` and command to get the flag :D
