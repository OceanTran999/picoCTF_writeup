We can see that there're 2 arrays, the `hands` is the computer pick random, and the `loses` is for checking whether the the player's input is the same as the index of `loses` array. Let take an example, if the user's input is `rock`, and the random value is `1`, which the computer will randomly choose `paper` in `hands` array, when checking the user's input with the `loses` array, they are not the same, which is `scissors`, so the user loses (also the `0` value). By contrast, if the random value is `2`, the computer randomly chooses `scissors`, which means in `loses` array is `rock`. Therefore, the user's input and `loses[random value]` are same, the player wins.

Here's `main` function:

We can see that the program use `strstr()` in `play` function, here's the man page about this function:

To solve this, you just input the string that combine all the element in given arrays, because `strstr()` will find the first occurence of the string `loses[computer_return]` in string `player_return`. With this input, we feel like invincible ;)
